# L2G Lensless Imaging

## Note

Currently, this work is under review, and the associated agreement document will be made available soon.

## Done

We have open-sourced the code for the utilities section used in our research process, which contains some basic operations during processing lensless imaging data, as its structure is relatively clearer and requires minimal documentation.

## Todo

Due to the ongoing review process, the code, particularly those reconstruction modules, is not yet available for open-source distribution. It still requires finalization, refinement, and thorough documentation. These contents are still in progress before the code can be made available.

## Acknowledgements

This study involves two publicly available datasets: [DiffuserCam](https://waller-lab.github.io/LenslessLearning/dataset.html) and [PhlatCam](https://siddiquesalman.github.io/flatnet/). We express our gratitude to all the authors who make these resources publicly available.
